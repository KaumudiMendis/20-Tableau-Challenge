Analysis on the phenomenons uncovered.

First phenomenon uncovered is that that more trips/Trip durations are done during summer period.
Also, the bike type which had been used throughout the year is Classic_bikes.

Second phenomenon is based on the comparison of the Trip duration used by Members and Casual riders shows that casual riders have used the bikes far more than members. 
Docked bikes have not been used by the members at all. 
It is better to have investigated why and how number of memberships can be improved.
Also will need to investigate the cost related to Docking_bike type repairs compared to Electric bike and how carefully casual users use the bikes.

Another phenomenon is based on the count of Ride Id and Trip duration hours for each month split across Bike Type.  
The data is filtered on each month, which ranges from July 2021 to June 2022.
The analysis from this graph indicates that ratio Count of Rides :Trip Durations is a positive  for Classic Bikes and Electric Bikes. 
However for Docked bikes the ratio will result in  negative value.


Finally it seems like most trips starts around Grove Path station and Hoboken Terminal areas. 
Therefore must allow more bikes to be available around these areas to avoid extensive usage and lower the repair costs.

Age or gender base analysis could not be done due to non availability of data for the period from July 2021 to June 2022.
